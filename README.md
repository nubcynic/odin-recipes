WHAT ? Build a basic recipe website.

HOW ? The website will consist of a main index [html page]. It will link to food recipes. The recipe contains proper image, description, ingredients (in ul list) and steps (in ol list).
Each recipe has own html pages. Each recipe links to index page and vice-versa.

WHY? Practise basic HTML. Reflect on the knowledge acquired.
